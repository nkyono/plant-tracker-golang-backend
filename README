go run plant-router

pulls data from AWS dynamoDB
handles HTTP request and returns json of plants species and plant occurrences

    -> date to & from
    -> accuracy

Current access points
GetPlants: retreives all the plant species from the database
GetOccurrences: retrieves all the occurrences from the database. main filter on plantID, then date and accuracy filtered later
AddItem: adds a singular item to the database. also creates the occurrenceID using sha1 on current time.
(In future addItem will potentially be where the machine learning model will identify plant and accuracy.)

AddItems: Not accessible. Used to fill database with fake testing data
